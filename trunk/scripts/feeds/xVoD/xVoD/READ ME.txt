-myvod.tv it's broke on playonhd but it works from firefox...

IMPORTANT:

For now the only scrapers with download feature are 10starmovies, cinetube, hdbox, maroc, megavideolink and watchnewfilms.
It's not recommended to download 2 files at the same time.



HOW IT WORKS:

1-Choose one of the sites mentioned below and select a movie, then click OK in the cover of the movie you want to download.
2-Click OK in your prefered mirror (megavideo/megaupload, flv links or bitload links of kino.to)
3-Click the key 2. The movie will start to be downloaded to movie folder of your hard drive


TODO:

Feature to stop the download without turning off the player.
