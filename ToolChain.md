  * get a Linux PC
  * install packages: binutils,
  * get the compiler from here: http://download.conceptronic.net/GNU-GPL/CM3Gxx/toolchain/mipsel-sdelinux-v6.05.00-4.i386.rpm and install-in
  * update your PATH environment variable to include mipsel-linux-gcc and the other new binaries
  * happy compiling
  * (I recommend static compilation to not have surprises while running the binary on the target)
