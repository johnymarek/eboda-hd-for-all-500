#summary Tool Chain installation

= warning =

The compiler is quite old one, I have currently some issues compiling some newer sources.
I'll try to build another compiles based on uclibc http://www.uclibc.org/toolchains.html method and I will use that one if everything OK. You can watch the progress here [Toolchain2 Second MIPS toolchain]

= Introduction =

This is the description of toolchain installation process. More info can be found here: http://www.linux-mips.org/wiki/Toolchains


= Details =

  # Download vmwayer from vmware for free
  # download a RPM based Linux disribution vmware image (from vmware appliances, I used the LinHost) - I used Fedora Core 12
  # Download sources + read-me file from ftp://download.conceptronic.net/Conceptronic/GNU-GPL/CM3Gxx/ and follow the readme file from last version (2.00.004):
    # Toolchain (install rpm files and untar *inc_lib0808.tar.bz2* file to /usr/local/mipsel-linux/):
      # mipsel-sdelinux-v6.05.00-4.i386.rpm
      # sdelinux-5.03.06-1.i386.rpm
      # inc_lib0808.tar.bz2
    # you will also need to execute
{{{
cp /usr/local/lib/gcc-lib/mipsel-linux/2.96-sdelinuxmips-040127/*.o /usr/local/lib/gcc-lib/mipsel-linux/2.96-sdelinuxmips-040127/soft/
}}}
  # Now you should be able to compile cross-compile opensource application based on automake/autocong using `--host=mipsel-linux` extra argument.

= Back .. =

After few days playing with uclibc toolchain generation (nice stuff) I got the binaries I wanted but .... they are not working.

What I got was: 
1. static lighttpd, nice size, but SIGSEGV right after reading configuration file
2. shared lightppd was ok
3. shared php-cgi running without ini file, but not usefull un-configured
4. shared php-cgi with ini file SIGSEGV

Probably the issue is the uclibc version I used that is different from what is on the board. I'll may take a look how could I handle this, bot is not looking right to have two versions anyhow (memory usage)

So I'm back to original toolchain and I'll grab older versions of applications to be able to really compile (even I think the compiler is not configured especially for this chip ...)
