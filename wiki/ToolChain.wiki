  # Download vmwayer from vmware for free
  # download a RPM based Linux disribution vmware image (from vmware appliances, I used the LinHost) - I used Fedora Core 12
  # Download sources + read-me file from ftp://download.conceptronic.net/Conceptronic/GNU-GPL/CM3Gxx/ and follow the readme file from last version (2.00.004):
    # Toolchain (install rpm files and untar *inc_lib0808.tar.bz2* file to /usr/local/mipsel-linux/):
      # mipsel-sdelinux-v6.05.00-4.i386.rpm
      # sdelinux-5.03.06-1.i386.rpm
      # inc_lib0808.tar.bz2
    # you will also need to execute
{{{
cp /usr/local/lib/gcc-lib/mipsel-linux/2.96-sdelinuxmips-040127/*.o /usr/local/lib/gcc-lib/mipsel-linux/2.96-sdelinuxmips-040127/soft/
}}}
  # Now you should be able to compile cross-compile opensource application based on automake/autocong using `--host=mipsel-linux` extra argument.
