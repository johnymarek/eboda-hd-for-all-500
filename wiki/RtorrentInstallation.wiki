= Rtorrent Installation =

Rtorrent is a promising torrent client for embedded, but for the moment I still work to get a stable configuration. The default configuration is to fast and is using to much RAM memory.

If you want to experiment just go ahead, but it may freeze your MP.

Telnet to your media player with optware package installed and execute the following command:
{{{
wget http://eboda-hd-for-all-500.googlecode.com/files/rtorrent-install.sh && sh rtorrent-install.sh && rm rtorrent-install.sh
}}}
