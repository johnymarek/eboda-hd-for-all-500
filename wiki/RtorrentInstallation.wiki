#summary rtorrent installation

= Rtorrent Installation =

Rtorrent is a promising torrent client for embedded. It was not easy, but for the moment I got a stable configuration in *swap is activated* (see http://code.google.com/p/eboda-hd-for-all-500/wiki/SwapOn) and only one torrent is downloaded at a time.

Telnet to your media player with optware package installed(this is already instaled if you have firmware from this page" and execute the following command:
{{{
wget http://eboda-hd-for-all-500.googlecode.com/files/rtorrent-install.sh && sh rtorrent-install.sh && rm rtorrent-install.sh
}}}
